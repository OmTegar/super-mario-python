Ideas taken from previous games:
  -Simplified code such as creating a function to detect enemy collision instead of seperately detecting collision for enemies.

Intended features:
  -Smooth movement
  -Smooth jumping and gravity
  -Ability to replay
  -How to play
  -8 levels
  -Can play as Mario, Luigi, or Yoshi and maybe Wario.
  -Smooth movement of enemies.
